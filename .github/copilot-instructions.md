# T-Craft Platforms – Copilot Instructions

T-Craft Platforms is an open-source organisation focused on Minecraft plugins, mods,
and the infrastructure required to run them.

This is not a company.

## General Guidelines

- Prefer clarity and simplicity over cleverness
- Avoid overengineering
- Assume contributors are developers, not end users
- Do not introduce monetisation, tracking, or paid proprietary dependencies

## Code Style

- Follow existing code style and conventions in each repository
- Keep changes small and focused
- Prefer readable, maintainable solutions
- Avoid unnecessary abstractions

## Project Context

Depending on the repository, projects may include:

- Minecraft plugins or mods
- Kubernetes or infrastructure tooling
- Backend services and automation

Always respect the scope and purpose of the repository.

## Workflow Expectations

- Issues come first, then branches, then pull requests
- Never suggest pushing directly to `main`
- Prefer solutions that are easy to review and test

## Communication

- Issues are for concrete technical work
- Discussions are for questions, ideas, and general help
- This is not a support ticket system
